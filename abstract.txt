UCSDMap, A Short Prose Description:

UCSDMap is a web-based application for finding the locations of, and shortest
paths between, buildings or areas on the campus. A Java (Swing) editor is used
to enter information about locations and the paths between them. This data is
then exported in a format that can be read by a web interface. In the
interface, one or two locations can be selected from a drop-down menu, or
searched for via a text field. If one location is selected, the map is
centered on that spot. If two are selected, both are displayed and the
shortest path between them is highlighted, along with the distance of the path
and approximate walking time.
