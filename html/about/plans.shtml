<h2>Plans</h2>

<p>Many parts of the application are not yet complete. This is a very brief
outline of what we still plan to do. (This will all probably get done between
the end of Summer Session I and the beginning of Fall 2005.) Crossed-off items
have been completed.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>A better base map.</b> The current map is just the visitor map
	PDF. (It even still has the key in the upper right-hand corner!) We
	plan on using the colored visitor map, such as is used by <a
	href="http://maps.ucsd.edu/Viewer.htm?Zoom=2&Map=Visitor&O.x=88&O.y=73&Cmnd=Mgfy&View=Medium&P.x=206&P.y=154">maps.ucsd.edu</a>.</li>

	<li><b>Complete path data.</b> The current path data is for
	demonstration only and is in no way complete. Once we obtain a final
	base map and create a scaled base image for use in the editor, we'll
	enter in the complete path data.</li>

	<li><b>Complete building codes.</b> The application supports
	associating a building code with each location (i.e., &quot;PCYNH&quot;
	with &quot;Pepper Canyon Hall&quot;), but they have not been
	entered.</li>

	<li><strike><b>Google Maps-style scrolling.</b> Who can resist?</strike></li>

	<li><b>Other interface improvements.</b> We'll get rid of some of the
	existing rough edges in the interface to make it easier and quicker to
	use.</li>

</ul>

<p>...plus anything else that comes up.</p>

<h2>Extensibility</h2>

<p>
	These features are not specifically planned, but they are listed to
	give an idea of how this project could expand:

</p>


<ul>
	<li><b>Building maps.</b> Click on an individual building name to open
	a sub-map (complete with all the features of the existing map --
	locations, path finding, etc) of the inside of that building.</li>

	<li><b>Maps of other locations.</b> With the editor, it is easy to add
	path data to any map.</li>

	<li><b>Integration with other applications.</b> Each location may have
	an associated building code, so it is easy for external applications
	that know building codes to build URLs for the map. I.e., to show the
	path between CENTR and PCYNH, you simply add the following to the map
	URL: &quot;?from=<b>CENTR</b>&amp;to=<b>PCYNH</b>&quot;.</li>

</ul>
