Step #1: Subversion checkout
    Check out CampusMap from subversion:
    http://michaelkelly.org/svn/CampusMap

Step #2: CPAN install
cpan> install Text::WagnerFischer
cpan> install Heap::Fibonacci
cpan> install HTML::Template
cpan> install GD

Step #3: Get the scripts working
Do basic apache config stuff to get cgi-bin working.

Link in the following from subversion...
disconnected.pl     -> /Perl/util/disconnected.pl
lib/                -> /Perl  
js_tmpl.html        -> /Perl/js_tmpl.html
#map.cgi             -> /Perl/map.cgi
    Due to apache2 config problem, copy this file.
plain_tmpl.html     -> /Perl/plain_tmpl.html
print_tmpl.html     -> /Perl/print_tmpl.html

Create the following folders:
cache
data

Copy the following from subversion...
/data/*.dat data/

This can be tested by going to http://server.../cgi-bin/map.cgi

Step #4: Link in the pretty stuff + images
mkdir public_html/ucsdmap

Link in the following from subversion
drag.js     -> /drag.js
menus.js    -> /menus.js

BLAH!  The static stuff we need is all over the place.  This needs to be fixed.
I just copied it all straight over.

Other notes:
create a /dynamic folder in the static directory (and chmod 777)
chmod 777 on /cache

You must have base-images for the plain interface and printing.
Also required is thumbnail.gd2
